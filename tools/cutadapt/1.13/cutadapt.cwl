# Finding adapters
  adapter-R1:
    type: File?
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 3' end (paired data: of the first
      read). The adapter and subsequent bases are trimmed. If a '$' character
      is appended ('anchoring'), the adapter is only found if it is a suffix
      of the read.
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --adapter=
      separate: false
  front-R1:
    type: string?
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 5' end (paired data of the first
      read). The adapter and any preceding bases are trimmed. Partial matches
      at the 5' end are allowed. If a '^' character is prepended ('anchoring'),
      the adapter is only found if it is a prefix of the read.
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --front=
      separate: false
  anywhere-R1:
    type: string?
    doc: |
      Sequence of an adapter that may be ligated to the 5' or 3' end (paired
      data of the first read). Both types of matches as described under -a und
      -g are allowed. If the first base of the read is part of the match, the
      behavior is as with -g, otherwise as with -a. This option is mostly for
      rescuing failed library preparations - do not use if you know which end
      your adapter was ligated to!

  overlap:
    type: int
    default: 3
    doc: |
